## Eloquent Searches

Are you tired of write __if, where and join statements in all your search methods__ as if tomorrow never comes, then this might be a solution for you!

Perform searches with Eloquent models using an array-like API setup.

_This library is just a query-builder translator, so in the end it uses exactly the same methods._
